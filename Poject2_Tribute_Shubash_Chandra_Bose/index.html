                <h2>Netaji</h2>
                <p>Subhas Chandra Bose 23 January 1897
                    – 18 August 1945 was an Indian nationalist whose defiance of British authority in India made
                    him a hero among many Indians, but his wartime alliances with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan
                    left a legacy vexed by authoritarianism, anti-Semitism, and military failure. The honorific
                    Netaji (Bengali: "Respected Leader") was first applied to Bose in Germany in early 1942—by the
                    Indian soldiers of the Indische Legion and by the German and Indian officials in the Special
                    Bureau for India in Berlin. It is now used throughout India.[h]</p>
